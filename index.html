<!-- In 2008, the Great Recession In 2018, the number of Washington State's homelessness population has risen to match Great Recession numbers. The cause: rising rents and stagnant wages.  about 46% of the states population has been rentburden  while, at the same time, more households  with an increase in the number of individuals experiencing homelessness has reached Great Recession numbers, and rapidly increasing rents are leaving low-income families with few options to live. The consequences of -->
<p>Evictions contribute to homelessness due to rising rents, the lack of affordable housing, and rent burden.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 2018, the number of citizens who were homeless reached Great Recession numbers.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The average rent in all of Washington rose from under $800 to $1,000 between 2003 and 2019, which means you need to make about $40,000 in 2019<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> to avoid rent burden (paying more than 30% of your income to rent). In order to afford to rent an average-priced home in King County, where rents have reached $2,200, you need to make about $90,000, in Clark County you need about $65,000, and in Pierce you need about $55,000.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Current homelessness is related to the rapid population growth in the major metropolitan areas with housing construction not being able to keep pace with demand. For instance, between 2010 and 2017, the population in King county rose from 1.931 to 2.189 million,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> a growth of 13.3%. At the same time the number of housing units rose by 7.9%, from 835,600 to 902,100.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> As result, Washington State has lost over 90,554 affordable rentals<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> since 2000, where 85% (76,865) of those homes disappeared between 2012 and 2017.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> These affordable units were lost to either increased rent or demolition. As a result of growing inequality,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> the current housing crisis is more concentrated toward the low wage population. During the Great Recession, households lost their homes due to a broad economic crisis impacting every facet of the economy but today, it is mostly impacting a portion of the population that never really recovered from the recession.</p>
<p>Research shows that low-income households are most likely to be evicted where stagnant wages and inadequate welfare are unable to compete with increases in rent. Research also shows that 80% to 90% of evictions are due to falling behind on rent where over 1/3rd of the defendants in the study were contributing over 80% of their income to rent.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In 2017, 46% of Washington households were rent burdened (contributing more than 30% of your income to rent) with about half of those households contributing more than 50% of their income to rent. This means that thousands of households are constantly on the verge of losing their home to an increase in rent or eviction due to rent burden.</p>
<p>The University of Washington’s Eviction Project was formed in the Summer of 2018 to measure and analyze this complex issue of evictions using court records, census data, and housing market trends across the state. We combine advanced data science techniques with demographic, urban sociology, and economic theory to understand how rent, changing neighborhoods, homelessness, and evictions relate to housing insecurity.</p>
<p>What we have found so far is troubling.</p>
<p><strong><em>Washington Evictions Are:</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong><em>Pervasive</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>Between 2013 and 2017, 1 in 55 Washingtonian adults had an eviction (130,203 adults which equals 1.8% of the State’s adult population)</li>
<li>Between 2004 and 2017, 397,697 adults have received a formal eviction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>A Civil Rights Issue</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>Black adults are over-represented in the eviction process when their group’s population consists of at least 5% of the county’s total population.</li>
<li>In Pierce County, 1 in 6 black adults has had an eviction between 2013 and 2017. In King County, 1 in 11 black adults has had an eviction in King County over the same time period. For white adults, 1 in 50 in Pierce County and 1 in 100 in King were evicted.</li>
<li>Women are evicted more than men across the state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong><em>Legally Under-Represented</em></strong>
<ul>
<li>only 8% of unlawful detainer defendants had legal representation at some point in their eviction process.</li>
<li>The most common resolution for an eviction is a default judgment–a no-show to a court hearing. In these circumstances, unlawful detainer defendants are almost guaranteed to receive the maximum penalty and fines requested by the landlord, putting them further behind than just losing their home.</li>
</ul></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> The purpose of this website</h2>
<p>In light of the increases of rent and lack of affordable housing, there is no wonder why we are seeing an increase in the number of citizens who are homeless. Given that evictions contribute to this problem, and that it is a highly understudied phenomenon in Washington, we believe it is important to share these findings with the public as soon as possible, raise awareness to the issue, and provide tools for policymakers to address this issue. In most contexts, academics publish these types of findings in journals that rarely reach the public eye. Therefore, we created this website to host a living document that will be frequently updated as we find new results. This early version shows the basics of what we have found so far. Over the next year, we will be adding more content and context.</p>

<!-- ##  Why are evictions a civil rights issue and not just an economic issue?

Given that evictions with the black and Latinx population our findings of disproportionality among    and taking into account prior research on racial disparities in evictions and at large for the black population, we identify three intersectional dynamics that make evictions among black individuals

1. Differential exposure
    * We observe that the rate of evictions is disproportionately higher among Washington's black population over any other group. This means that black adults are at the highest risk of eviction between 5 and 7 times more than white adults.
2. Additional inequities and burden
    * Unobserved mechanisms that put black adults at a greater disadvantage in everyday life.
      - They are exposed to additional burdens, inequities, and institutional discrimination
      - Evidence -->
<!-- 3. differential direct-effect -->
<!-- * A white tenant with the same characteristics as a black tenant may be less likely to be evicted -->
